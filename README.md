# Sports-ball-segregation-Object-localization-using-deep-learning-based-multi-output-CNN

Sports is one of the most important aspects of a person’s life. Every person has played sports in their life. The sports industry is also a great source of entertainment for people which further generates enormous revenue. A lot of technological advancements have been introduced to improve people’s experience and decisions in various sports. However, sports involving fast-moving elements especially balls need to completely track the movement and also localize its position at all times. In this paper, an object detection and localization technique is proposed that can be used on-field in various sports games, and also in various sports mall for sports balls segregation. In the proposed methodology, six types of sports balls which include football, cricket, basketball, 8-ball, tennis, and baseball are used to form the dataset. A deep learning based neural network named Sports Ball multi-output Convolutional Neural Network (SBmoCNN) is proposed to detect the type of ball and locate its location in the image frame. The model was trained and evaluated under 5 types of background color frames – white, black, red, green and blue. The multi-output CNN was able to achieve a good average accuracy of 0.9927 for ball detection. IoU metric is used for the evaluation of the ball localization for which average accuracy of 0.9016 was obtained.
